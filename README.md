# Features

# Running a Copy

## Setup

This README assumes you're hosting on Heroku.

Make sure you have keys for the following accounts and update them in `.envs` file. Rename the file to `.env`

1. [Mailgun API](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup)
2. [Heroku postgres database](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
3. JWT secret. [How to generate one using node](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens#how-to-generate-secret-key)

## Run

Heroku can run this out of the box as long as you have the .env variables set uo and a postgres database provisioned.

To run the site locally for development, run this in ../lottery/:

```
npm run start:dev
```

This will start a nodemon that will restart the server when it detects changes to the source.

To run the client, open another terminal and cd to the /client/ directory and run:

```
npm run start
```

This will use react-script's daemon to restart on source changes.
